BookTribe was created for fellow bookworms and avid readers to connect in a fun and creative space. Future features down the pipeline for the app would include a community forum feature, gamification of reading goals, and a writer's platform for readers to create their own work.&#x20;

## User Persona

To ensure that our application meets the needs of our users, a user persona was created to help us understand our users and their habits better.&#x20;

This allows us to look at existing products and identify areas of improvement. Some existing competitors that was analysed were GoodReads, StoryGraph, BookSloth, etc.
